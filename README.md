# Shopping Cart Application
This repository contains two versions of a Shopping Cart application implemented in Core Java. One version uses Java arrays, and the other uses Java collections like ArrayList, LinkedList, and HashSet. Both versions provide a dashboard for performing CRUD operations on products and display all orders without involving any DBMS. The application also adheres to a layered architecture.
